Airport Challenge
=================

This project models a simple airport which can land planes and release them. It deals with such issues as airport capacity and weather which may make it difficult to land.

Technology
----------

Ruby - Simple demonstaration of classes using Ruby, not too exciting
Capybara/Rspec - main functionaility shows off functionaility of these testing frameworks, the use of unit tests for airports and planes.
IRB - the user interface is assumed to be command based using IRB

Key stuff - unit tests mock out functionaility from other classes, using 'doubles' and 'stubs'
          - random behaviour (weather) is mocked out again using a 'stub'

Future Enhancements and feedback
  - weather is included as a method inside the airport class, it would be better as a seperate module.


Written as part of Makers Academy - weekend Challenge, 2015.
